External modules & tools
------------------------

These are the modules used by ``sidebar.node.js`` and some tools. They are available on npm to install.

### 1. fs - file system module

This module doesn't include any licensing documents. But, ``README.md`` said this:

> # Security holding package
> 
> This package name is not currently in use, but was formerly occupied
> by another package. To avoid malicious use, npm is hanging on to the
> package name, but loosely, and we'll probably give it to you if you
> want it.
> 
> You may adopt this package by contacting support@npmjs.com and
> requesting the name.

### 2. inherits - browser-friendly inheritance
